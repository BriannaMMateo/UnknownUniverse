# UnknownUniverse
 For my CSC240 Computer Graphics course I created a game using Javascript and Blender.

Welcome to the Unknown Universe! 

## INTRO:
You are a robot that was traveling in a UFO and somehow got dropped down into an unknown universe, we don’t know how you got here or how to get you out! You’ve reported to your UFO pilot that you’ve somehow made it on this unknown universe and need to get out. The UFO pilot said he will try to get you back as soon as possible, but no telling how long it’ll take. 
So, in the meantime, let’s play a fun game!  

Once Game is Loaded: Click Window to Start

### WHAT TO DO:

Your task is to collect the special pink gems to bring back to your friends and family. The pink gems are randomly placed across the plane of the universe. Using the arrow keys, when you approach the pink gem it will be collected and stored in “Your Score” at the top of the screen. Collect 30 special pink gems and YOU WIN! Once you win,the game stops. To play again press the spacebar to restart the game.

### LOSING LIVES :

You are granted 3 lives in each gameplay. Watch out for those tall rock-like cylinders! The tall rock-like cylinders are randomly placed across the plane of the universe. Each time you bump into one you lose a life. If you lose all 3 of your lives, YOU LOSE, and the game stops. To play again press the spacebar to restart the game. Your lives are displayed at the top of the screen as “Lives:”.

### INVINCIBILITY COUNTDOWN:

If you bump into a cylinder you lose a life and gain Invincibility time of 300 that will countdown to 0. During the 300 to 0 countdown, you cannot lose another life if bumped into a cylinder. When the Invincibility Countdown reaches 0, you are no longer Invincible and are now capable of losing another life again. You can also see your “Invincibility Countdown” displayed at the top of the screen.

### OTHER INFO:

You are bounded within the plane, to prevent you from getting more lost within the unknown universe! Since the pink special gems are randomly generated, if you start gameplay and “Your Score:” is 1, that means the gem was randomly generated in or near your position and it was collected and stored in “Your Score”. Great! The more the merrier! Similar to the tall-rock-like cylinders, because they are randomly generated, there may be times at the start of new gameplay that it generates on top of you and prevents you from moving, OR  if it's placed very close to you, this may cause you to immediately lose a life. If this happens just press the spacebar to restart the game.
